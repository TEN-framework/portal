Find answers to common questions and solutions to typical issues when working with TEN Agent.

## Installation & Setup

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Why do I see '/app/agent/bin/start: not found'?">
    This error typically occurs on Windows due to line-ending issues. Git may convert LF (Unix) line endings to CRLF (Windows), which breaks shell scripts.

    **Solution:**

    1. Configure Git to keep LF line endings:

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    git config --global core.autocrlf false
    ```

    2. Delete your local copy and re-clone the repository:

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    git clone https://github.com/TEN-framework/TEN-Agent.git
    ```

    **Alternative:** Download the ZIP file directly from GitHub instead of cloning.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I verify my internet connection?">
    Make sure both HTTPS and general connectivity are working properly.

    **Test HTTPS connection:**

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    ping www.google.com

    # Expected output:
    PING google.com (198.18.1.94): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 198.18.1.94: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.099 ms
    64 bytes from 198.18.1.94: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.121 ms
    ```

    **Test HTTP connection:**

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    curl www.google.com

    # Expected output (redirect response is normal):
    <html>
    <head><title>301 Moved Permanently</title></head>
    <body>
    <h1>301 Moved Permanently</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    <Callout type="info">
      If you're behind a corporate firewall or proxy, you may need to configure Docker and Git to use your proxy settings.
    </Callout>
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Configuration

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="How do I refresh environment variables?">
    When you update your `.env` file, the running server won't automatically pick up the changes.

    **To apply new environment variables:**

    1. Stop the running server (Ctrl+C)
    2. Save your changes to the `.env` file
    3. Restart the server with `task run`

    <Callout type="info">
      Inside the Docker container, you don't need to run `source .env` - the server will read the file on startup.
    </Callout>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where do I get the required API keys?">
    You'll need API keys from these services:

    | Service | Purpose | Get Key |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    | Agora | Real-time communication | [Agora Console](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=web#create-an-agora-project) |
    | OpenAI | LLM processing | [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
    | Deepgram | Speech-to-text | [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com/) |
    | ElevenLabs | Text-to-speech | [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) |

    Most services offer free tiers or trial credits for getting started.

## Docker Issues

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Docker build is very slow on Apple Silicon Mac">
    If you're using an M1/M2/M3 Mac and experiencing slow builds, check your Docker settings.

    **Solution:**

    1. Open Docker Desktop settings
    2. Go to **General** or **Features in development**
    3. **Uncheck** "Use Rosetta for x86_64/amd64 emulation"

    <Callout type="warn">
      This may result in slightly slower build times on ARM, but runtime performance will be better. When you deploy to x64 servers, performance will be normal.
    </Callout>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Container fails to start or exits immediately">
    If the Docker container exits right after starting, check these common causes:

    1. **Port conflicts**: Make sure ports 3000, 8080, and 49483 are not in use
    2. **Resource limits**: Ensure Docker has at least 4GB RAM allocated
    3. **Missing .env file**: Verify `.env` exists and has valid API keys

    **Debug steps:**

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    # Check container logs
    docker logs ten_agent_dev

    # Check if ports are in use
    lsof -i :3000
    lsof -i :8080
    ```
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Runtime Issues

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Agent doesn't respond to voice input">
    If the agent starts but doesn't respond to your voice:

    1. **Check microphone permissions** in your browser
    2. **Verify API keys** are correctly set in `.env`
    3. **Check browser console** for WebRTC errors
    4. **Ensure Agora credentials** are valid and the project has RTC enabled

    <Callout type="info">
      Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab for error messages.
    </Callout>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I check if my agent is running correctly?">
    After running `task run`, verify these endpoints:

    - **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    - **TMAN Designer**: [http://localhost:49483](http://localhost:49483)
    - **API Server**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

    If any of these don't load, check the container logs for errors.
  </Accordion>
