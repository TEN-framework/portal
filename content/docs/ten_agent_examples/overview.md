## Key Concepts

**Real-Time Voice Agents**: TEN Agent supports full-duplex conversation with natural interruption handling, delivering seamless voice interactions.

**Modular Architecture**: Extend functionality through self-contained extensions. The core agent logic resides in the "main" extension, which you can customize for your use case.

**Multi-Language Support**: Build extensions in Python, Node.js, Go, or C++. Mix and match languages in a single agent.

**Production-Ready**: TEN Agent provides the infrastructure and patterns needed for deploying conversational AI at scale.
