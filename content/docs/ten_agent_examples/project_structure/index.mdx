The TEN Agent project is built on top of the TEN Framework. For basic concepts, see the [TEN Framework Overview](/docs/ten_framework/concept_overview).

## Key Components

### Configuration Files

<Callout type="info" title="property.json">
  The main runtime configuration file that defines how extensions are orchestrated. This is where you configure the graph of extensions and their connections.
</Callout>

Located in each agent example (e.g., `agents/examples/voice-assistant/property.json`), this file:

- Defines which extensions to load
- Specifies connections between extensions
- Sets extension-specific properties and API keys

See [property.json Reference](/docs/ten_agent_examples/project_structure/property_json) for detailed documentation.

### Extensions Directory

```
agents/ten_packages/extension/
```

Contains all available extension modules. Each extension is a separate package that can be written in:

- **Python** - For AI/ML integrations (LLMs, TTS, ASR)
- **Go** - For high-performance networking
- **C++** - For low-latency audio/video processing

Extensions are modular and reusable across different agent configurations.

See [Extension Structure](/docs/ten_agent_examples/project_structure/extension) for details on creating extensions.

### Server

```
server/
```

The backend web server responsible for:

- Handling HTTP/WebSocket requests
- Managing agent process lifecycle (start/stop)
- Routing requests to the appropriate agent instance

See [Server Architecture](/docs/ten_agent_examples/project_structure/server) for implementation details.

### Playground

```
playground/
```

A web-based UI for interacting with your agent:

- Real-time voice/video communication
- Extension configuration
- Debug and monitoring tools

Access at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) after starting the agent.

### Demo

```
demo/
```

Production-ready deployment configurations showcasing:

- Example agent setups
- Deployment best practices
- Integration patterns

## Agent Examples

The `agents/examples/` directory contains ready-to-use agent configurations:

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `voice-assistant` | Basic voice agent with STT → LLM → TTS pipeline |
| `realtime-agent` | OpenAI Realtime API integration |
| `story-teller` | Interactive storytelling agent |

To use an example:

```bash title="Terminal"
cd agents/examples/voice-assistant
task install
task run
```

## Next Steps

- [property.json Reference](/docs/ten_agent_examples/project_structure/property_json) - Understand the configuration format
- [Extension Structure](/docs/ten_agent_examples/project_structure/extension) - Learn how extensions are organized
- [Server Architecture](/docs/ten_agent_examples/project_structure/server) - Dive into the backend implementation
