Welcome to TEN! TEN stands for **Transformative Extensions Network**, an open-source framework for real-time multimodal conversational AI.

## Vision

The TEN framework is designed to establish a modular, flexible, and scalable platform that enhances development speed, maintainability, and scalability. The framework supports best engineering practices for modular development, enabling you to create robust, efficient, and adaptable applications by leveraging comprehensive mechanisms provided by the platform.
