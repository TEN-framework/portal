title: Configure Extension Nodes
---

Extensions (or modules) are the core building blocks of a voice agent. They define the capabilities and functionalities of the agent. With TMAN Designer, you can easily add, remove, or replace extensions of same kind to tailor the agent to your specific needs.

You can follow [this guide]("/docs/ten-agent/customize_agent/tman-designer/") to learn to launch TMAN Designer if you haven't done so already.

## Replace Extension Node

Replacing can be very useful when you want to replace a node with another node of same protocol, as it will keep the original connections while changing the underlying implementation (e.g. to a different vendor model).

To replace a module or extension in TMAN Designer, follow these steps:

1. Right click on the node you would like to replace, in the context menu, select "Replace Node With..."
2. In the popup window, select the extension implementation you would like to use with "Addon Name" text input field.
3. Click "Replace Node" to confirm the replacement.

<Callout title="Note">
The replacing extension will be using the properties defined in `property.json` by default.
</Callout>

## Add Extension Node

You can add an extension node to a graph with following steps:

1. Right click on an empty area in the canvas, in the context menu, select "Add Node"
2. In the popup window, select the extension implementation you would like to use with "Addon Name" text input field, and give the node a name with "Node Name" text input field. The node name needs to be unique in a graph.
3. Click "Add Node" to confirm the addition.

<Callout title="Note">
The added extension will be using the properties defined in `property.json` by default.
</Callout>

## Remove Extension Node

You can remove an extension you no longer need from graph by following these steps:

1. Right click on the node you want to remove, in the context menu, select "Delete"
2. Confirm the removal in the popup window.

## Supported Extension Categories

Some key categories of extensions are widely adopted in voice ai agent. In TEN-Agent these extensions are built using certain shared protocols so that it's easy to switch.

Following is a list of supported extension categories:

### Audio Speech Recognition (ASR)

- aliyun_asr
- aliyun_asr_bigmodel_python
- aws_asr_python
- azure_asr_python
- bytedance_asr
