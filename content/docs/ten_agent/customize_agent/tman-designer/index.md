title: Use TMAN Designer
---

TEN Manager includes a web UI-based visual development interface called TMAN Designer, which eases the process of creating and customizing voice agents. You can refer to [TEN Framework docs](/docs/ten_framework/tman_designer/overview) for more details about TMAN Designer.

This section provides various examples of how to use TMAN Designer to create and customize voice agents for different use cases.

In earlier versions of TEN Agent, we supported to use playground to customize voice agents. This has been deprecated. For latest version of TEN Agent, please use TMAN Designer to customize your voice agents.
