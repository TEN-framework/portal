## Build a Real-Time Transcription with TEN

Need a quick way to turn live speech into readable transcripts? The TEN transcription example pairs Agora RTC, a speech-to-text add-on, and a lightweight LLM polish pass to deliver clean captions in a single flow. This post breaks down the moving parts and shows how to run—and extend—the sample yourself.

> **Why TEN?** The runtime abstracts graph orchestration, so you can swap providers or add post-processing without rewriting your whole stack.

## Architecture at a Glance

1. **Agora ingress** captures microphone audio and pushes PCM frames and `stream-message` data into the graph.
2. **Stream ID adapter** normalises Agora payload IDs so downstream nodes stay in sync with the UI.
3. **Speech-to-Text (STT)** converts audio frames into partial and final transcripts.
4. **Main control** fans out ASR events, queues LLM prompts for optional clean-up, and forwards results to the collector.
5. **Message collector** batches payloads and emits them over Agora's data channel.
6. **Next.js UI** starts the graph, joins the channel, and renders raw vs polished text in real time.

Alongside the runtime graph you also get:

- `ten_packages/extension/main_python`: the orchestration extension that implements the transcription flow.
- `web/`: a minimal Next.js client that starts the graph, joins Agora, and displays transcripts.
- `manifest.json`: the app manifest that pins runtime and extension versions.

## Graph Wiring

The graph is declared in `ai_agents/agents/examples/transcription/property.json` and wires the whole loop together. A trimmed view highlights the core nodes:

```json title="ai_agents/agents/examples/transcription/property.json"
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "agora_rtc",
      "addon": "agora_rtc",
      "property": {
        "app_id": "${env:AGORA_APP_ID}",
        "channel": "ten_transcription",
        "publish_data": true
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "streamid_adapter",
      "addon": "streamid_adapter"
    },
    {
      "name": "stt",
      "addon": "deepgram_asr_python",
      "property": {
        "params": {
          "api_key": "${env:DEEPGRAM_API_KEY}",
          "language": "en-US"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "main_control",
      "addon": "main_python",
      "property": {
        "enable_llm_correction": true
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "llm",
      "addon": "openai_llm2_python"
    },
    {
      "name": "message_collector",
      "addon": "message_collector2"
    }
  ]
}
```

Connections bind each stage: Agora PCM frames flow through the `streamid_adapter` into the STT node; the resulting `asr_result` data stream triggers `main_control`; and the message collector publishes concatenated transcripts back into Agora so the UI can subscribe without extra transports.

## Inside `main_control`

The Python extension (`ten_packages/extension/main_python/extension.py`) is where ASR and LLM events are orchestrated. It registers handlers for each agent event, forwards partial transcripts immediately, and optionally calls the LLM when an utterance is final:

```python title="ten_packages/extension/main_python/extension.py"
@agent_event_handler(ASRResultEvent)
async def _on_asr_result(self, event: ASRResultEvent):
    self.session_id = event.metadata.get("session_id", "100")
    stream_id = int(self.session_id)
    if not event.text:
        return

    await self._send_transcript("user", event.text, event.final, stream_id)

    if event.final and self.config.enable_llm_correction:
        self.turn_id += 1
        prompt = self.config.correction_prompt.replace("{text}", event.text)
        await self.agent.flush_llm()
        await self.agent.queue_llm_input(prompt)
```

When the LLM streams back, `_send_transcript` republishes the polished text as an `assistant` role. Setting `enable_llm_correction` to `false` in the graph properties skips the clean-up pass and surfaces raw ASR output only.

## Event Queues and Backpressure

`main_control` delegates most orchestration to the lightweight `Agent` (`agent/agent.py`). Two asyncio queues guarantee ordered delivery and isolate ASR vs LLM work:

```python title="ten_packages/extension/main_python/agent/agent.py"
self._asr_queue: asyncio.Queue[ASRResultEvent] = asyncio.Queue()
self._llm_queue: asyncio.Queue[LLMResponseEvent] = asyncio.Queue()

async def _consume_asr(self):
    while not self.stopped:
        event = await self._asr_queue.get()
        await self._dispatch(event)

async def _consume_llm(self):
    while not self.stopped:
        event = await self._llm_queue.get()
        self._llm_active_task = asyncio.create_task(self._dispatch(event))
        try:
            await self._llm_active_task
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            self.ten_env.log_info("[Agent] Active LLM task cancelled")
```

Because LLM responses are processed in their own queue, the extension can cancel or flush in-flight prompts whenever a new final transcript arrives. Tool registration events (`tool_register`) also pass through the same dispatcher, so the graph can expose extra functions without touching the core logic.

## LLM Correction Loop

`agent/llm_exec.py` wraps streaming chat completions and handles reasoning traces. Each transcript chunk is queued as a `user` message, and the class manages cancellation plus context updates:

```python title="ten_packages/extension/main_python/agent/llm_exec.py"
async def _send_to_llm(self, ten_env, new_message):
    messages = self.contexts.copy()
    messages.append(new_message)
    request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    llm_input = LLMRequest(
        request_id=request_id,
        messages=messages,
        streaming=True,
        tools=self.available_tools,
    )
    async for cmd_result, _ in _send_cmd_ex(
        ten_env,
        "chat_completion",
        "llm",
        llm_input.model_dump(),
    ):
        ...
```

Reasoning deltas stream back as a separate channel, letting the UI present chain-of-thought data or hide it depending on the audience. If your model already returns clean text, disable correction and the loop simply passes through raw ASR events.

## Message Flow to the Browser

`message_collector2` emits segmented payloads using Agora `stream-message`. The Next.js client (`web/src/app/page.tsx`) reconstructs them, decodes the base64 payload, and pushes messages into local state:

```ts title="web/src/app/page.tsx"
const handleStreamMessage = useCallback((data: any) => {
  const ascii = String.fromCharCode(...new Uint8Array(data))
  const [message_id, partIndexStr, totalPartsStr, content] = ascii.split('|')
  ...
  const payload = JSON.parse(base64ToUtf8(msg))
  const { text, is_final, role } = payload
  appendItem({ id: message_id, text, isFinal: !!is_final, role: role || 'assistant', ts: payload.text_ts })
}, [])
```

Because everything flows through Agora, you can ship both audio and transcript data across the same connection—ideal for browsers that can’t open extra WebSocket ports.

## Running the Example

1. **Configure credentials** in the TEN repo root `.env`:
   - `AGORA_APP_ID`, `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE` (if tokens required)
   - `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` (or swap in another STT addon + credentials)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` plus optional `OPENAI_MODEL`, `OPENAI_PROXY_URL`
2. **Select the agent**:

   ```bash
   cd ai_agents
   task use AGENT=transcription
   ```

3. **Start the runtime** and leave it running:

   ```bash
   task run
   ```

4. **Launch the UI**:

   ```bash
   cd agents/examples/transcription/web
   cp .env.example .env  # set AGENT_SERVER_URL
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000`, click **Start**, allow microphone access, and watch transcripts stream in.

When the graph spins up it stays idle until the Agora client joins, so you’re only billed for STT/LLM usage while someone is actively publishing audio.

## Where to Take It Next

- **Swap providers**: point the STT node at Azure, Deepgram multilingual, or a self-hosted model—the graph contract stays intact.
- **Add summarisation**: queue an extra LLM node that occasionally summarises the conversation and stream it back as a different message type.
- **Persist transcripts**: mirror the collector payloads into a database or send them to a webhook alongside Agora stream metadata.
- **Expose tools**: register custom LLM tools (via `tool_register`) so corrections can call domain-specific APIs before presenting text.

The transcription example is intentionally lean, but every piece is production ready: the runtime graph keeps latency predictable, the Python control extension deals with post-processing, and the browser client demonstrates a simple, vendor-agnostic UI surface. Use it as a template for live captioning, meeting notes, or any workflow where polished text needs to trail the spoken word by only a heartbeat.
