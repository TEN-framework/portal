## The Problem with Traditional Voice Assistants

You're asking your voice assistant a complex question:

> "Tell me about the best restaurants in Portland. Oh, and can you also show me options that have outdoor seating?"

A traditional voice assistant with basic Voice Activity Detection (VAD) faces a dilemma:

- Does the pause after "Portland" mean you're done talking?
- Is "Oh, and..." a continuation, or a new request?
- Should it respond immediately or keep listening?

Simple timing-based solutions fail here. You need something smarter: **turn detection**.

## What is Turn Detection?

Turn detection is the **contextual evolution beyond Voice Activity Detection**. While VAD answers "Is this speech or noise?", turn detection answers the deeper question: **"Has the speaker finished their complete thought?"**

### The Three States of Conversation

Turn detection classifies each transcription segment into one of three states:

| State | Meaning | Assistant Action |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **Finished** | Speaker has completed their thought | Process and respond |
| **Unfinished** | Speaker is mid-sentence or thinking | Keep listening |
| **Wait** | Ambiguous; waiting for clarity | Hold briefly, then timeout |

This isn't based on silence duration or audio amplitude. Instead, it uses **AI reasoning** to understand conversational context.

## How It Works: The Architecture

Turn detection in the TEN Framework uses a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) deployed on GPU infrastructure. Here's the flow:

```
User speaks continuously
    ↓
Real-time STT (Deepgram) streams transcription chunks
    ↓
Each chunk → Turn Detection Model (Fine-tuned LLM)
    ↓
Model analyzes: "Is this thought complete?"
    ├─ finished → Send to LLM for response
    ├─ unfinished → Continue collecting audio
    └─ wait → Hold with timeout
    ↓
Once finished: LLM generates response → TTS → User hears it
```

### Why Use an LLM for Turn Detection?

You might wonder: Can't we just use heuristics or simple machine learning?

The answer is **no**—not reliably. Consider these examples:

**Example 1: Natural Pauses**
> "I'm thinking about... taking a vacation next month."

A simple silence detector would interrupt. Turn detection understands "thinking about" as a filler phrase with a pause, not the end of a thought.

**Example 2: Compound Requests**
> "Book me a flight to NYC. Actually, make that Boston."

Turn detection recognizes this as a single turn with a self-correction, not two separate requests.

**Example 3: Question-Answer Sequences**
> "What's the weather in London? And what about Paris?"

These are contextually related—turn detection groups them together rather than responding after "London".

An LLM, especially one fine-tuned on conversational data, understands these patterns naturally.

## GPU Deployment with Cerebrium

To make turn detection fast enough for real-time conversations, the TEN Framework uses **Cerebrium**, a platform for deploying AI models on GPUs.

Here's why this matters:

- **Speed**: GPU inference for LLMs drops response time to milliseconds
- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of concurrent conversations
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for compute you use
- **OpenAI-compatible API**: Drop-in integration with your existing tools

### Deployment Process

```bash
# 1. Create Cerebrium account at https://www.cerebrium.ai/

# 2. Install CLI and login
pip install cerebrium
cerebrium login

# 3. Deploy the turn detection model
cd agents/examples/voice-assistant-with-turn-detection/cerebrium
cerebrium deploy

# 4. Get your credentials
# Base URL: https://api.cortex.cerebrium.ai/v4/p-xxxxx/ten-turn-detection-project/run
# API Key: Your Cerebrium token
```

The deployment loads the `TEN_Turn_Detection` model (fine-tuned for conversation understanding) on an NVIDIA A10 GPU and exposes it via OpenAI-compatible API.

## Real-World Benefits

### 1. **Natural Conversation Flow**

Users can speak in their natural style without awkward pauses or artificial phrasing. The assistant understands when to listen and when to respond.

**Before**: "Hello." *awkward pause* "How. Are. You." *waits for response*

**After**: "Hello, how are you? I'm looking for a restaurant." *assistant waits for full thought, then responds*

### 2. **Better Interruption Handling**

What happens if a user interrupts themselves?

> "I want to book a flight to—wait, actually, I need to check my calendar first."

Turn detection recognizes this as a single turn with a course correction, not two conflicting requests.

### 3. **Improved Context Understanding**

When the LLM processes the user's input, it sees the complete thought, not fragmented pieces. This leads to more accurate responses and better handling of complex queries.

### 4. **Reduced Latency**

Despite adding an extra LLM call, turn detection can *reduce* overall latency because:

- It avoids responding prematurely and being interrupted
- It batches fragments into complete thoughts
- The final LLM response is more accurate (fewer clarifications needed)

## Architecture: The Full Stack

Here's how everything works together in a Voice Assistant with Turn Detection:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           User Speaking (Microphone)                │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Audio Streaming (Agora RTC)                     │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Speech-to-Text (Deepgram)                         │
│   Produces real-time transcription chunks           │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Turn Detection (Fine-tuned LLM on Cerebrium GPU)  │
│   Classification: finished/unfinished/wait          │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────┘
                   ↓
            [finished?]
           /            \
        YES              NO
         ↓                ↓
    LLM Response    Continue listening
         ↓
    Text-to-Speech (ElevenLabs)
         ↓
    Audio Output (User hears response)
```

Each layer is independently configurable:

- **Audio**: Switch from Agora to another RTC provider
- **STT**: Use Azure, Speechmatics, or AssemblyAI instead of Deepgram
- **Turn Detection**: Adjust sensitivity or model parameters
- **LLM**: Switch from OpenAI to Claude, Llama, or Coze
- **TTS**: Use Azure TTS, Cartesia, or Fish Audio instead of ElevenLabs

## Getting Started

```bash
# Prerequisites: Complete Cerebrium GPU deployment (see above)

# Install dependencies
task install

# Configure environment variables
# Set: TTD_BASE_URL, TTD_API_KEY, DEEPGRAM_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, ELEVENLABS_TTS_KEY

# Run the assistant
task run

# Access:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
# - API: http://localhost:8080
# - Designer: http://localhost:49483
```

## Customization with TMAN Designer

The visual designer at `http://localhost:49483` lets you:

- **Fine-tune turn detection sensitivity** — More aggressive vs. lenient
- **Adjust timeout thresholds** — How long to wait in ambiguous states
- **Add tools and integrations** — Weather, calendar, database lookups
- **Change prompts** — Custom system prompts for different use cases
- **Add capabilities** — Plugin new features without code

You can build complex agent behaviors by chaining components together, all visually.

## Advanced Configurations

### Multi-Language Support

Turn detection works across languages. Configure Deepgram for your target language, and the turn detection model adapts automatically:

```bash
# Support English and Spanish
DEEPGRAM_LANGUAGE=en,es
```

### Custom System Prompts

Modify the LLM's behavior by customizing its system prompt in the designer:

```
"You are a helpful restaurant reservation assistant.
You ask clarifying questions about party size,
preferred cuisine, and dietary restrictions before
confirming bookings."
```

### Interrupt Handling

Turn detection supports graceful interruption:

```
User: "Tell me about Tokyo"
       [3 seconds of content]
Assistant starts: "Tokyo is a vibrant city..."
User: "Wait, I meant Bangkok!"
       [Turn detection flags as new turn]
Assistant pivots: "Bangkok is known for..."
```

## Comparison: Turn Detection vs. VAD

| Aspect | Voice Activity Detection (VAD) | Turn Detection |
|--------|--------------------------------|----------------|
| **Question answered** | "Is this speech?" | "Is this thought complete?" |
| **Method** | Audio analysis (spectrograms) | Semantic analysis (LLM) |
| **Handles pauses** | Sometimes error-prone | Highly accurate |
| **Handles complex requests** | Not context-aware | Understands intent |
| **Latency** | ~50ms | ~200-500ms (including LLM) |
| **Best for** | Basic speech detection, noise filtering | Natural conversation, complex queries |
| **GPU required** | No | Yes |

## When to Use Each

**Use VAD if**:
- You need ultra-low latency (IoT, embedded systems)
- Simple commands and responses
- Limited infrastructure for GPU deployment

**Use Turn Detection if**:
- Multi-turn conversations
- Complex, compound requests
- Natural conversation is critical
- You have GPU infrastructure

Many applications use **both**: VAD first to filter noise, then turn detection for semantic understanding.

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Breakdown

For a typical request:

- Audio capture: ~20ms
- STT (Deepgram streaming): ~100-300ms
- Turn detection (GPU LLM): ~200-300ms
- LLM response generation: ~500-1500ms (depending on complexity)
- TTS synthesis: ~500-1000ms
- **Total**: 1-3 seconds for a complete response

This feels natural to users—similar to a real person thinking and responding.

### Cost Optimization

Cerebrium provides different tier options:

- **Free tier**: 50,000 requests/month (testing)
- **Starter**: $99/month for 1M+ requests
- **Enterprise**: Custom scaling for high-volume deployments

The fine-tuned turn detection model is smaller and faster than a full LLM, so costs are reasonable for most applications.
