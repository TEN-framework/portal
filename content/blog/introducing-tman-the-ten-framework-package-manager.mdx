# Introducing TMAN: The TEN Framework Package Manager

Building real-time multimodal AI applications shouldn't require juggling multiple package managers, complex dependency chains, and fragmented tooling. That's why we created **TMAN** (TEN Manager) — the all-in-one command-line tool that makes developing with the TEN Framework fast, simple, and enjoyable.

Released last week, TMAN brings together project scaffolding, dependency management, visual development, and deployment into a single, powerful CLI tool. Whether you're building a voice assistant, transcription service, or complex multi-agent system, TMAN streamlines your entire workflow.

## What is TMAN?

TMAN is the official package manager and development tool for the TEN Framework. Think of it as npm for Node.js, cargo for Rust, or pip for Python — but specifically designed for building multimodal AI agents.

At its core, TMAN handles:

- **Package Management**: Install and manage 60+ pre-built extensions (ASR, TTS, LLM, tools)
- **Project Scaffolding**: Create new apps and extensions from battle-tested templates
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically resolve complex dependency trees with version constraints
- **Visual Development**: Launch an integrated graph designer for building agent workflows
- **Build & Deploy**: Package and publish your extensions to the TEN registry

## Getting Started in 60 Seconds

Installing TMAN is a breeze. Choose your preferred method:

### macOS (via Homebrew)

```bash
brew install TEN-framework/ten-framework/tman
```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ten-framework/ten-framework
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tman
```

### Universal Install Script

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework/main/tools/tman/install_tman.sh)
```

The install script automatically detects your OS and architecture (x64, ARM64) and downloads the correct binary. Within seconds, you're ready to go.

Verify your installation:

```bash
tman --version
```

## Creating Your First AI Agent

Let's build a real-time transcription app in less than 5 minutes:

```bash
# Create a new app from the transcriber template
tman create app my-transcriber --template transcriber_demo

# Navigate to your app
cd my-transcriber

# Install dependencies (extensions, systems, addons)
tman install

# Install Python/npm dependencies
tman run install_deps

# Build the application
tman run build

# Start your AI agent
tman run start
```

That's it! You now have a fully functional real-time transcription service running locally. TMAN handled:

- Scaffolding the project structure
- Resolving and installing extension dependencies
- Setting up the build environment
- Launching the application server

## Key Features That Make TMAN Special

### 1. Smart Dependency Resolution

TMAN uses a sophisticated constraint solver to resolve complex dependency graphs. It supports:

- **Semantic versioning**: `tman install extension openai_llm2_python@^1.0.0`
- **Lock files**: Generates `manifest-lock.json` for reproducible builds
- **Development vs Production**: Separate dev dependencies with `--production` flag
- **Local development**: Link local packages with `--local-install-mode link`

```bash
# Install all dependencies from manifest.json
tman install

# Install a specific extension
tman install extension deepgram_asr_python

# Install with version constraint
tman install extension openai_llm2_python@1.0.0

# Link a local extension for development
tman install ./my-custom-extension
```

### 2. Visual Graph Designer

One of TMAN's killer features is the built-in visual designer. Launch it with:

```bash
tman designer
```

This opens a web interface at `http://localhost:49483` where you can:

- **Drag-and-drop extensions** to build agent workflows
- **Configure properties** with a visual editor
- **Browse the extension marketplace** with 60+ pre-built components
- **Live preview** your agent graphs
- **Export configurations** directly to `property.json`

The designer bridges the gap between code and visual development, making it easy for both developers and non-developers to collaborate on AI agent architectures.

### 3. Multi-Language Support

TMAN handles extensions written in multiple languages seamlessly:

- **Python**: For AI/ML libraries and rapid prototyping
- **Go**: For high-performance, concurrent processing
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: For web integrations and Node.js ecosystems
- **C++**: For low-level performance and custom audio/video processing

Each language has its own addon loader, but TMAN abstracts away the complexity. Install a Python extension alongside a Go extension, and TMAN ensures everything works together.

### 4. Custom Scripts and Automation

Define custom scripts in your `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "python3 start.py",
    "build": "npm run build && python3 build_extensions.py",
    "test": "pytest tests/",
    "deploy": "docker build -t my-agent . && docker push my-agent"
  }
}
```

Then run them with:

```bash
tman run start
tman run build
tman run test -- --verbose  # Pass extra args after --
```

This standardizes your workflow across different projects and team members.

### 5. Package Publishing

Built a reusable extension? Share it with the community:

```bash
# Package your extension
tman package
# Creates .ten/package/my_extension.tpkg

# Publish to the TEN registry
tman publish
```

Your extension becomes available for anyone to install with `tman install`.

## Real-World Use Cases

### Voice Assistant Development

```bash
# Create a voice assistant with turn detection
tman create app voice-agent --template voice-assistant-with-turn-detection

cd voice-agent
tman install

# Launch the designer to customize the pipeline
tman designer

# Run the agent
tman run start
```

### Extension Development Workflow

```bash
# Create a custom extension
tman create extension my_sentiment_analyzer --template default_extension_python

cd my_sentiment_analyzer

# Edit your extension code
# ... implement your logic ...

# Test locally by linking to an app
cd ../my-app
tman install ../my_sentiment_analyzer

# Package and publish when ready
cd ../my_sentiment_analyzer
tman package
tman publish
```

### CI/CD Integration

TMAN works great in automated pipelines:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04

# Install tman
RUN curl -fsSL https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework/releases/download/0.11.42/tman-linux-release-x64.zip -o tman.zip \
    && unzip tman.zip \
    && cp ten_manager/bin/tman /usr/local/bin/

# Install dependencies
COPY manifest.json .
RUN tman install --production

# Build and run
COPY . .
RUN tman run build
CMD ["tman", "run", "start"]
```

## Under the Hood

TMAN is built with Rust, giving it exceptional performance and reliability. Here's what powers it:

- **clap**: For intuitive command-line parsing
- **actix-web**: Serves the designer web interface
- **tokio**: Asynchronous runtime for concurrent operations
- **semver**: Handles semantic versioning logic
- **reqwest**: Communicates with the TEN package registry

The result? A blazingly fast CLI that handles complex operations in milliseconds.

## Platform Support

TMAN runs everywhere you need it:

- Linux x64 (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)
- Linux ARM64 (Raspberry Pi, ARM servers)
- macOS Intel (x64)
- macOS Apple Silicon (ARM64)
- Windows x64

Pre-built binaries are available for all platforms on our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework/releases).
