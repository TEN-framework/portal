## Introducing TEN Designer

In version 0.9.0 of the TEN Framework, we're excited to introduce **TEN Designer** - a powerful visual development tool designed to enhance developer experience. This release represents our team's commitment to addressing the community's needs for a more intuitive development environment.

### What's New?

TEN Designer brings several key improvements:

- Enhanced developer usability
- Streamlined AI Agent development
- Seamless integration of cloud-edge computing
- Real-time audio/video capabilities

Our team is dedicated to continuously improving TEN Designer through upcoming versions, focusing on feature expansion and bug fixes.

## TEN Framework Overview

The TEN Framework offers a comprehensive suite of features:

- TEN Cloud Store
- Package management
- Multi-language support
- Multi-platform compatibility

While these powerful features provide great flexibility, we understand they can present a learning curve. That's why we've developed **TEN Manager** - a command-line tool that simplifies the process of modifying and customizing AI Agents.

## TEN Designer: The Visual Solution

Recognizing that command-line interfaces aren't everyone's preferred choice, TEN Manager now includes TEN Designer - a web-based visual development interface. This powerful GUI provides:

- Rich development tools
- Debugging capabilities for TEN Apps
- Extension development support
- Unified development environment

With TEN Manager, developers get the best of both worlds: a complete development environment featuring both command-line and graphical interfaces.
