</div>

TEN framework github : https://github.com/TEN-framework

You can download https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten_designer_demo_app as the demo TEN app for this article.

---

In version 0.9.0 of the TEN Framework, a visual development tool called TMAN Designer was introduced to enhance developer usability. This marks a proactive response from the TEN Framework team to the community‚Äôs urgent demand for improved development experience. Moving forward, the team will accelerate efforts in upcoming version iterations to continuously enhance and expand TMAN Designer‚Äôs features and fix bugs. This will make it easier and more convenient for developers to use TMAN Designer to develop or customize AI Agents based on the TEN Framework, enabling seamless integration of cloud-edge computing and real-time audio/video capabilities.

---

TEN Framework offers high flexibility and provides rich functionalities, including TEN Cloud Store, package management, multi-language support, and multi-platform support. However, these features may require a longer learning period and higher technical threshold to master TEN Framework for AI Agent development and customization. To facilitate developers‚Äô use, TEN Framework provides a command-line tool called TEN Manager, which enables developers to easily modify and customize AI Agents built with TEN Framework.

---

Since command-line tools are not as user-friendly as graphical user interfaces, TEN Manager includes a web UI-based visual development interface called TMAN Designer, in addition to the command-line interface. It provides rich functionality to help developers develop and debug TEN Apps and TEN Extensions. This means that developers only need to obtain the TEN Manager tool to access a complete TEN Framework development environment with both command-line and graphical user interfaces.

---

You can get TMAN Designer from the following link:

```
https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework/releases/tag/0.9.0
```

TMAN Designer supports the following operating systems and architectures. Please obtain the appropriate version for your platform:

```
- Windows : x86_64
- Linux : x86_64
- MacOS : x86_64, arm64
```

After downloading and extracting, use the following command to start TMAN Designer:

```
tman designer
```

You can execute this command in the root directory of any TEN App, or in any location. If executed in the root directory of a TEN App, TMAN Designer will load that TEN App by default. You can also manually load any TEN App in TMAN Designer. Therefore, starting TMAN Designer in the root directory of a specific TEN App is not mandatory, but it simplifies the initial step of manually loading a TEN App.

After startup, you will see information like the following, indicating that TMAN Designer starts on port 49483 by default:

```
üèÜ  Starting server at http://0.0.0.0:49483
```

You can interact with TMAN Designer using the following URL:

```
http://127.0.0.1:49483/
```

Note: If your TMAN Designer is running on a remote machine, please use the IP address of the remote machine to access TMAN Designer.

## Working with TEN Apps

### Loading an Existing TEN App

You can load an existing TEN App using the Load App button in the App menu. After clicking the button, you will see the following interface:

![](https://ten-framework-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/tman-designer/tman-3.webp)

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", fontSize: "0.9em" }}>
  Loading an Existing TEN App
</div>

Through this file browser dialog, developers can specify the root directory of an existing TEN App to load it.

---

### Managing Loaded TEN Apps

You can manage loaded TEN Apps using the Manage Loaded App(s) button in the App menu. After clicking the button, you will see the following Apps Manager interface:

![](https://ten-framework-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/tman-designer/tman-4.webp)

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", fontSize: "0.9em" }}>
  Managing Loaded TEN Apps
</div>

---

Developers can use this dialog to:

- Unload loaded TEN Apps
- Reload specified TEN Apps
- Reload all loaded TEN Apps
- Install all dependencies for specified Apps
- Run functions for specified Apps

---

### Installing All Dependencies for an App

Developers can install various TEN packages in a TEN App. All TEN packages that a TEN App depends on are recorded in the manifest.json file. Here is an example of a manifest.json file:

```json
{
  "type": "app",
  "name": "aaa",
  "version": "0.8.18",
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "type": "system",
      "name": "ten_runtime",
      "version": "0.8.18"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_muxer",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_demuxer",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "ffmpeg_client",
      "version": "^0.1.0"
    },
    {
      "type": "protocol",
      "name": "msgpack",
      "version": "^0.8.18"
    }
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "start": "python3 tools/run_script.py start",
    "build": "python3 tools/run_script.py build"
  }
}
```

From the above configuration, we can see that this TEN App depends on the following TEN packages:

- ten_runtime: The system package of TEN Framework
- ffmpeg_demuxer: A TEN Extension package for decoding audio and video
- ffmpeg_muxer: A TEN Extension package for encoding audio and video
- ffmpeg_client: A TEN Extension package for processing audio and video using the other two ffmpeg extension packages
- msgpack: A TEN Protocol package for message serialization and deserialization using the MessagePack protocol

After completing the installation of all dependencies for the TEN App, the TEN package file structure in the system looks like this:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ten_packages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_client
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_demuxer
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg_muxer
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ protocol
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ msgpack
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ system
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ffmpeg
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ten_runtime
```

It‚Äôs worth noting that even though it‚Äôs not explicitly declared in the manifest.json, there is an additional ffmpeg system package in the system. This is because ffmpeg_demuxer and ffmpeg_muxer depend on the ffmpeg system package, and TEN Manager automatically identifies and installs these transitive dependencies.

Through the Apps Manager interface in TMAN Designer, developers can perform the Install All operation on a specified App to easily complete the installation of all dependencies. After clicking the button, you will see the following interface showing the installation progress:

## Installing TEN Extensions from the Cloud Store

You can open the TEN Cloud Store and install TEN Extensions to the current TEN App using the Open Extension Store button in the Graph menu. After clicking the button, you will see the following interface:

![](https://ten-framework-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/tman-designer/tman-6.webp)

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", fontSize: "0.9em" }}>TEN Cloud Store</div>

In the TEN Cloud Store, developers can search for the required TEN Extensions and click the Install button to install them to the current TEN App. After installation, you can view the installed TEN Extensions in the current TEN App.

## Running a TEN App

In the Apps Manager, you can perform preset runtime operations on the specified App. After clicking the Run button in the Apps Manager, you will see the following interface:

![](https://ten-framework-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/tman-designer/tman-7.webp)

<div style={{ textAlign: "center", fontSize: "0.9em" }}>Running a TEN App</div>

In the dialog, developers can select the preset operation to execute from the dropdown menu. These typically include the following operations:

- Run App: Start the App and display the App‚Äôs output information in the TMAN Designer message window.
- Build App: Compile the App. Since TEN Framework supports multiple programming languages, some languages need to be compiled while others do not. For example, TEN Apps developed in C++ need to be compiled, while TEN Apps developed in Python do not.

Below is the build interface for a TEN App developed in C++:

## Working with TEN Graphs

## Loading an Existing TEN Graph

You can load an existing TEN Graph using the Open Existing Graph button in the Graph menu. After successful loading, you will see an interface similar to the following:

![TEN Graph](https://ten-framework-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/blog/tman-designer/tman-10.webp)

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '0.9em' }}>

TEN Graph

</div>

Using this Graph as an example, it contains 3 TEN Extensions, namely:

- ffmpeg_demuxer
- ffmpeg_muxer
- ffmpeg_client

Each TEN Extension has its corresponding inputs and outputs. For example, `ffmpeg_demuxer` has the following inputs and outputs:

- 2 cmd inputs
- 1 cmd output
- 1 audio_frame output
- 1 video_frame output

Clicking on the number buttons for inputs and outputs opens a dialog like the following, which is used to manage input and output connections:
