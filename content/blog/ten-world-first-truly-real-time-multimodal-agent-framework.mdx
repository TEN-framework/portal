In version 0.9.0 of the TEN Framework, a visual development tool called TEN Designer was introduced to enhance developer usability. This marks a proactive response from the TEN Framework team to the community’s urgent demand for improved development experience. Moving forward, the team will accelerate efforts in upcoming version iterations to continuously enhance and expand TEN Designer’s features and fix bugs. This will make it easier and more convenient for developers to use TEN Designer to develop or customize AI Agents based on the TEN Framework, enabling seamless integration of cloud-edge computing and real-time audio/video capabilities.

TEN Framework offers high flexibility and provides rich functionalities, including TEN Cloud Store, package management, multi-language support, and multi-platform support. However, these features may require a longer learning period and higher technical threshold to master TEN Framework for AI Agent development and customization. To facilitate developers’ use, TEN Framework provides a command-line tool called TEN Manager, which enables developers to easily modify and customize AI Agents built with TEN Framework.

Since command-line tools are not as user-friendly as graphical user interfaces, TEN Manager includes a web UI-based visual development interface called TEN Designer, in addition to the command-line interface. It provides rich functionality to help developers develop and debug TEN Apps and TEN Extensions. This means that developers only need to obtain the TEN Manager tool to access a complete TEN Framework development environment with both command-line and graphical user interfaces.
