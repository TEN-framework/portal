## Build a Live2D Voice Assistant with TEN Framework

Imagine building a **voice assistant that's more than just audio** — one with an **animated anime character** that moves its lips in perfect sync with speech, reacts naturally, and brings conversations to life.

With the TEN Framework, you can create exactly that: a **real-time Live2D voice assistant** where animated characters respond to your voice with **audio-driven mouth movement** and seamless interaction.

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to integrate **Live2D models** with **TEN's voice pipeline** to create an immersive conversational experience.

---

## What is this article all about?

TEN Framework provides the **real-time audio pipeline** (STT → LLM → TTS), and your job is to create a **beautiful frontend** that brings it to life:

* **Real-time lip sync** → mouth movements synchronized with TTS audio output.
* **Interactive Live2D characters** → 2D anime models that react and animate naturally.
* **Seamless audio integration** → Agora RTC streams audio directly to Live2D MotionSync.
* **Modular backend** → reuse the standard voice assistant backend, focus on frontend magic.

This means you get **all the power of TEN's voice pipeline** while delivering a **visually engaging user experience** that goes beyond traditional chatbots.

---

## Project Structure

You don't need to build everything from scratch — TEN Framework provides a **ready-to-use Live2D voice assistant example** in the repository.

👉 Find it here: [**voice-assistant-live2d example on GitHub**](https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework/tree/main/ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant-live2d)

### Backend (tenapp)

The backend is essentially the **same as other TEN voice assistant examples**:

```
tenapp/
├── property.json       → TEN graph configuration
└── ten_packages/
    └── extension/
        └── main_python/ → Main control extension
```

By default, it uses:
- **Agora RTC** for real-time audio streaming
- **Deepgram** for speech-to-text
- **OpenAI LLM** for conversation
- **ElevenLabs** for text-to-speech

Just like other TEN examples, **you can easily swap in different vendors** (e.g., use Google ASR, Azure TTS, Anthropic Claude, etc) using the **graph designer at [http://localhost:49483](http://localhost:49483)** (TMAN Designer) — no code changes needed. This gives you full flexibility to mix and match components to fit your needs.


The real innovation is in the **frontend**.

### Frontend (Next.js + Live2D)

The frontend is where the magic happens:

```
frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Live2DCharacter.tsx    → Main Live2D rendering component
│   │   ├── ClientOnlyLive2D.tsx   → SSR-safe wrapper
│   │   ├── ConnectionPanel.tsx    → RTC connection controls
│   │   └── TranscriptPanel.tsx    → Conversation display
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── pixi-setup.ts          → PixiJS global initialization
│   │   ├── live2d-loader.ts       → Live2D model loader
│   │   └── request.ts             → API client
│   └── app/
│       └── page.tsx               → Main application
└── public/
    └── models/
        └── kei_vowels_pro/        → Live2D model assets
```

This structure keeps **rendering logic**, **audio processing**, and **RTC integration** cleanly separated.

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend brings the Live2D character to life. Let's break down the key parts:

---

### 1. PixiJS Setup

Before loading Live2D models, we need to **initialize PixiJS globally** because `pixi-live2d-display` expects it.

[`pixi-setup.ts`](https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework/blob/main/ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant-live2d/frontend/src/lib/pixi-setup.ts) handles this:

```ts
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';

// Set up PIXI globally for pixi-live2d-display compatibility
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    window.PIXI = PIXI;
    globalThis.PIXI = PIXI;
}

export { PIXI };
export default PIXI;
```

👉 This ensures PixiJS is available before any Live2D operations begin.

---

### 2. Loading Live2D Models

[`live2d-loader.ts`](https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework/blob/main/ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant-live2d/frontend/src/lib/live2d-loader.ts) dynamically imports the Live2D library after PixiJS is ready:

```ts
import PIXI from './pixi-setup';

export async function loadLive2DModel() {
    // Wait for PIXI to be fully set up
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200));

    // Now dynamically import Live2D
    const { Live2DModel } = await import('pixi-live2d-display/cubism4');

    return { Live2DModel, PIXI };
}
```

👉 This **lazy-loading strategy** prevents SSR issues and ensures proper initialization order.

---

### 3. The Live2DCharacter Component

[`Live2DCharacter.tsx`](https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework/blob/main/ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant-live2d/frontend/src/components/Live2DCharacter.tsx) is the heart of the frontend. It handles:

#### **Model Initialization**

```ts
const initLive2D = async () => {
    // Create PIXI application with canvas renderer
    const app = new PIXI.Application({
        view: canvasRef.current!,
        autoStart: true,
        resizeTo: canvasRef.current?.parentElement || window,
        backgroundColor: 0x000000,
        backgroundAlpha: 0,
        forceCanvas: true,  // Use canvas for stability
    });

    // Load Live2D model
    const { Live2DModel } = await import('@/lib/live2d-loader')
        .then(loader => loader.loadLive2DModel());

    const model = await Live2DModel.from(modelPath);
    app.stage.addChild(model);

    // Position and scale the model
    model.scale.set(parent.clientHeight / model.height);
    model.x = (parent.clientWidth - model.width) / 2;
};
```

#### **MotionSync for Lip Sync**

The component uses **Live2D MotionSync** to synchronize mouth movements with audio:

```ts
// Initialize MotionSync
const motionSyncUrl = modelPath.replace('.model3.json', '.motionsync3.json');
const motionSync = new MotionSync(model.internalModel);
await motionSync.loadMotionSyncFromUrl(motionSyncUrl);

// When audio track arrives from Agora...
if (audioTrack && audioTrack.getMediaStreamTrack) {
    const stream = new MediaStream([audioTrack.getMediaStreamTrack()]);

    // Start lip sync playback
    motionSync.play(stream);

    // Also play actual audio
    const audio = document.createElement("audio");
    audio.autoplay = true;
    audio.srcObject = stream;
    audio.play();
}
```

👉 This creates **perfectly synchronized lip movements** — the character's mouth moves exactly as it "speaks".

---

### 4. Agora RTC Integration

The main page ([`page.tsx`](https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework/blob/main/ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant-live2d/frontend/src/app/page.tsx)) connects everything:

```ts
// When remote audio arrives from TTS
rtcClient.on("user-published", async (user, mediaType) => {
    if (mediaType === "audio") {
        await rtcClient.subscribe(user, "audio");
        const remoteAudioTrack = user.audioTrack;

        // Pass audio to Live2D component for lip sync
        setRemoteAudioTrack(remoteAudioTrack);

        // Play the audio
        remoteAudioTrack?.play();
    }
});
```

Then pass it to the Live2D component:

```tsx
<ClientOnlyLive2D
    modelPath={currentModel.path}
    audioTrack={remoteAudioTrack}
    onModelLoaded={() => console.log("Model loaded!")}
/>
```

👉 The character **automatically syncs its mouth** whenever the voice assistant speaks.

---

### 5. SSR Handling

Since Live2D requires browser APIs, we use **dynamic imports** to prevent SSR issues:

```tsx
const ClientOnlyLive2D = dynamicImport(
    () => import("@/components/ClientOnlyLive2D"),
    {
        ssr: false,
        loading: () => <div>Loading Live2D Model...</div>
    }
);
```

👉 This ensures the Live2D component **only renders on the client side**.

---

## Test It Out
