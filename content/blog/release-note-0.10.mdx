# 🚀 TEN Framework 0.10 — Powering the Next Wave of Voice AI Agents

We’re excited to announce **TEN Framework v0.10**, our biggest release yet. This version focuses on making it easier than ever to build **real-time, customizable, and cross-language voice AI agents** — without sacrificing performance.

---

## 🌍 What’s New in 0.10

* *Main Extension with Customizable Logic* - In v0.10, TEN introduces a streamlined **`main` extension** that acts as the central pipeline for your agent. It preserves all of TEN’s cross-language and high-performance benefits, while giving you a clean entry point to **inject and customize your business logic** — without touching the underlying foundation. For details, check out our [Main Extension Guide](/docs/ten_agent/customize_agent/modify-main).

* *Unified Realtime Protocols (v2.0)* - Upgraded ASR, MLLM Realtime, TTS, and LLM protocols. The new TTS protocol brings WebSocket-based TTS providers with **lower latency, context-aware synthesis, and better error/metrics handling**.

* *Expanded Vendor Ecosystem* - Official support for **Sonniox, Speechmatics, and Hume.ai**, and more, alongside existing providers — giving you more flexibility to choose the best tools for your use case.

* *Official Node.js Support* - Node.js now joins Python and C++ as a first-class runtime. You can reuse all existing C++/Python extensions and orchestrate your entire agent in Node.js.

* *TMAN Designer UI Upgrade* - A refreshed UI makes designing and managing pipelines faster, simpler, and more intuitive.
