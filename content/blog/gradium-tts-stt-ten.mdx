# Real-time voice with Gradium TTS & STT in TEN

We just shipped two new voice integrations for TEN: **Gradium speech-to-text (STT/ASR)** and **Gradium text-to-speech (TTS)**. They unlock low-latency, ultrarealistic audio for assistants, copilots, and any product that needs to sound human while responding in real time. Explore Gradium at [gradium.ai](https://gradium.ai/).

## TL;DR
- Gradium STT streams transcriptions over WebSockets with interim and final results, plus VAD support to keep latency low.
- Gradium TTS generates lifelike PCM audio (48 kHz by default) and streams it back instantly for smooth turn-taking.
- Both ship as TEN extensions (`gradium_asr_python` and `gradium_tts_python`) with simple JSON config and region-aware endpoints (US/EU).
- Designed for real-time loops: microphone -> Gradium STT -> reasoning -> Gradium TTS -> speaker, all under one TEN app graph.

## Why Gradium voice inside TEN
TEN already handles streaming I/O, session state, and routing between extensions. Gradium fits perfectly into that pipeline: its WebSocket APIs keep round trips tight, while the voice quality feels natural enough for production-grade customer experiences. Combining the two lets you prototype and ship responsive voice agents without gluing together separate services.

## What we shipped

### Gradium STT (ASR)
- WebSocket streaming for real-time transcription with interim and final results.
- Multi-region endpoints (`wss://us.api.gradium.ai/api/speech/asr`, `wss://eu.api.gradium.ai/api/speech/asr`).
- VAD-aware flow so you can trim silence and speed up responses.
- Flexible inputs: PCM, WAV, or Opus with 16-bit mono audio (24 kHz recommended).

### Gradium TTS
- Streaming TTS that emits 16-bit PCM audio at 48 kHz by default, with options for 16 kHz and 24 kHz PCM.
- Works with any Gradium voice ID and model name; keep the style consistent across product surfaces.
- Region-aware WebSocket endpoint (`wss://<region>.api.gradium.ai/api/speech/tts`) plus simple `GRADIUM_API_KEY` auth.

## Quick start: wire both into a TEN app

1) Set your API key:

```bash
export GRADIUM_API_KEY=your_gradium_key
```

2) Add Gradium STT and TTS nodes to your TEN graph (simplified example):

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "gradium_asr",
      "addon": "gradium_asr_python",
      "extension_group": "gradium_asr_group",
      "property": {
        "params": {
          "api_key": "${env:GRADIUM_API_KEY|}",
          "region": "us",
          "model_name": "default",
          "input_format": "pcm",
          "sample_rate": 24000
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "extension",
      "name": "gradium_tts",
      "addon": "gradium_tts_python",
      "extension_group": "gradium_tts_group",
      "property": {
        "params": {
          "api_key": "${env:GRADIUM_API_KEY}",
          "region": "us",
          "model_name": "default",
          "voice_id": "YOUR_GRADIUM_VOICE_ID",
          "output_format": "pcm"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "connections": [
    {
      "extension_group": "microphone_group",
      "extension": "microphone",
      "audio_frame_out": [
        {
          "name": "pcm_frame",
          "dest": [
            {
              "extension_group": "gradium_asr_group",
              "extension": "gradium_asr"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "extension_group": "llm_router_group",
      "extension": "llm_router",
      "text_out": [
        {
          "name": "reply_text",
          "dest": [
            {
              "extension_group": "gradium_tts_group",
              "extension": "gradium_tts"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3) Start your TEN app and you have a full duplex loop: mic -> Gradium STT -> LLM/tooling -> Gradium TTS -> speakers.

## Optimization tips for low latency
- **Match sample rates**: keep STT input at 24 kHz mono PCM and TTS output at 48 kHz PCM for fidelity; downsample only once at the edge.
- **Use VAD**: let Gradium STT handle silence trimming to shorten end-of-utterance delays.
- **Cache voices**: pick a single Gradium `voice_id` per session to avoid extra lookups.
- **Stay regional**: choose the closest Gradium region (US/EU) for lower round-trip time.
- **Stream small chunks**: send ~80 ms PCM chunks (1,920 samples at 24 kHz) to keep transcripts flowing smoothly.

## Where to use it
- Customer support and sales agents that need natural prosody and tight response loops.
- Real-time copilots in productivity or creative tools where hands-free operation matters.
- Multilingual kiosks, IVRs, and embedded devices that rely on reliable ASR plus high-quality playback.

## Ready to try?
Gradium voice is live in TEN today. Grab an API key from [gradium.ai](https://gradium.ai/), drop your config into `property.json`, and ship a voice experience that sounds human and responds fast. If you build something cool with Gradium TTS or STT, let us know; we'd love to feature it next.
