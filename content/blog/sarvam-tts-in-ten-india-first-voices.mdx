Sarvam just shipped an India-native text-to-speech experience: **11 Indian languages
with authentic accents**, a **low-latency API built for real-time calls**, and
pronunciation tuned for real-world, domain-heavy content (all straight from
their [official TTS page](https://www.sarvam.ai/apis/text-to-speech)). New
sign-ups even get **₹1000 in free credits** to try it.

Good news: TEN already includes a drop-in Sarvam HTTP TTS extension at
`ai_agents/agents/ten_packages/extension/sarvam_http_tts`. You can wire it into
any TEN agent in a couple of minutes.

## Why Sarvam + TEN

- India-first voices: one memorable voice across 11 Indian languages with
  authentic accents.
- Real-time ready: low-latency API for live assistants and IVRs.
- Domain-aware: trained on real-world Indian data to handle names, abbreviations,
  and numerics cleanly.
- Friendly onboarding: free ₹1000 credits, with custom pricing once you scale.

## What ships in TEN

- **Extension**: `ai_agents/agents/ten_packages/extension/sarvam_http_tts`
  (manifest + tests).
- **Voices & controls**: BCP-47 language codes, speakers (`anushka`, `manisha`,
  `vidya`, `arya`, `abhilash`, `karun`, `hitesh`), `pitch`, `pace`, `loudness`,
  and `speech_sample_rate` (8000/16000/22050/24000).
- **Model**: Bulbul (`model: "bulbul:v2"`) with base64 WAV decoding to PCM,
  built-in retries, optional dumping for debugging.

## Quick start

### 1) Point your app at the extension

Add the Sarvam extension path to your TEN manifest (pattern used in
`ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant/tenapp/manifest.json`):

```json
{
  "extensions": [
    { "path": "../../../ten_packages/extension/sarvam_http_tts" }
  ]
}
```

### 2) Configure TTS in your app property

Swap your TTS block to Sarvam (or add a new one) and set your API key
(`SARVAM_TTS_KEY`):

```json
{
  "type": "extension",
  "name": "tts",
  "addon": "sarvam_http_tts",
  "extension_group": "tts",
  "property": {
    "dump": false,
    "dump_path": "./",
    "params": {
      "api_subscription_key": "${env:SARVAM_TTS_KEY}",
      "target_language_code": "en-IN",
      "speaker": "anushka",
      "model": "bulbul:v2",
      "pitch": 0.0,
      "pace": 1.0,
      "loudness": 1.0,
      "speech_sample_rate": 22050,
      "enable_preprocessing": false
    }
  }
}
```

Other knobs you can set: `output_audio_codec`, `endpoint` (defaults to
`https://api.sarvam.ai/text-to-speech`), and `enable_preprocessing` to normalize
English words/numbers before synthesis.

### 3) Run your agent

Restart your TEN agent (or the sample voice assistant) and the TTS interface
will stream Sarvam audio back to your transport. If you want debug dumps, set
`dump: true` and inspect the PCM at `dump_path`.

## Tips for great output

- Use BCP-47 language codes (`hi-IN`, `bn-IN`, `en-IN`, etc.) to match Sarvam's
  language routing.
- Keep inputs under ~1500 characters and add commas in long numbers for clean
  pronunciation (`10,000` instead of `10000`).
- Tune `pitch`, `pace`, and `loudness` per voice; Bulbul responds naturally to
  moderate adjustments.
- For domain-heavy text, set `enable_preprocessing: true` and supply
  domain-specific terms directly—Sarvam is trained to keep them intact.

## Where to learn more

- Sarvam TTS docs: https://docs.sarvam.ai/api-reference-docs/text-to-speech-rest/convert
- TEN extension source: `ai_agents/agents/ten_packages/extension/sarvam_http_tts`
- Example manifest wiring: `ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant/tenapp/manifest.json`

India-first voices with low latency and a generous trial: a perfect fit for TEN
agents that need to sound local, fast, and trustworthy. Give Sarvam a spin and
ship a truly multilingual voice experience today.
